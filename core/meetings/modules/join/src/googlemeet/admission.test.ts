/**
 * Regression guard for the Google Meet admission detector.
 *
 * 1. #471 false-reject (FIXED): the "Asking to be let in" waiting screen shows
 *    a "Return to home screen" button. It used to be a googleRejectionIndicator,
 *    so `checkForGoogleRejection` classified a normal waiting screen as a host
 *    denial in ~4s (`awaiting_admission_rejected`) — the bot never waited for
 *    the host. Ported from Vexa-ai/vexa#471 (@priitvimberg): the button is now
 *    a WAITING indicator; genuine denials are still caught by the
 *    "denied your request" text patterns.
 *
 * 2. #444 conflation (STILL OPEN, narrowed by #471): googleRejectionIndicators
 *    keeps generic error-page affordances ("Try again", "Retry", "Go back",
 *    "Access denied", …) that also render on Google's bot-block / invalid-state
 *    pages, so a Google-side BLOCK is still thrown as "denial". The CONFLATION
 *    case below documents that remaining bug; when a block/error-vs-denial
 *    distinction lands (à la the Zoom zoom_requires_rtms detector), flip it.
 *
 * 3. #429 Gemini consent gate (Vexa-ai/vexa#454, @thatditsyboy): the
 *    "take notes for me" consent prompt is a pre-admission gate — meeting
 *    controls are visible behind it, so the bot false-reported ACTIVE with 0
 *    transcriptions. `hasConsentPrompt` detects it and
 *    `checkForGoogleAdmissionIndicators` suppresses the admitted signal.
 *
 * This test feeds the detectors a fabricated DOM for each scenario (no browser,
 * no live meeting, no Google).
 *
 * Run: npx tsx src/googlemeet/admission.test.ts
